Nothing to see here, folks, move along. Just testing git.
Inserting a new line on 2018-1-24 from branch my-first-branch...
This sentence was typed in GitHub's online editor.
Also, I added a few 's' characters to the first line, to see what a changed 
line looks like.
I then deleted those extra 's' characters and added this line on Monday,
February 20.

Testing line insertion. Inserted this line, and deleted the "Also, I added a few
's' characters to the first line" line.

This line was added on 2018-1-24 around 9pm.
On that same date, I also added a line break to a line above.

Random vim tips!
1. To record a macro, hit q, then a register [a-z], then do something, then hit
q again. Play back this register with [num]@[register name].
2. To rewrap lines in vim, select them in visual mode, then hit gq. This even
understands numbered lists, like this one!
3. Pasting plaintext into vim tends to be painful. I don't yet know the
detailed reasons why pasting is problematic, but the idiom to get used to is to
open vim, run :set paste, and paste to your heart's content.
