Nothing to see here, folks, move along. Just testing git.
Inserting a new line on 2018-1-24 from branch my-first-branch...
This sentence was typed in GitHub's online editor.
Also, I added a few 's' characters to the first line, to see what a changed line looks like.
I then deleted those extra 's' characters and added this line on Monday,
February 20.

Testing line insertion. Inserted this line, and deleted the "Also, I added a few
's' characters to the first line" line.
